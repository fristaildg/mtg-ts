      DONE [mtg-ts-backend] Refactor decks API endpoints (make 'getDecks' work with GET instead of POST)
      DONE Rework login / register (auth0?)
      - Remove old node.js User integration
      DONE [mtg-ts-backend] Integrate Auth0 users to Mongodb for deck associations
      - create game board page ('play match') that displays the selected deck
      - work on nice design
      - use styled-components (drop scss)
      - Refactor loading states (react Suspense?)
      - snackbars for users when async stuff is done (for example when deck was successfully saved)
